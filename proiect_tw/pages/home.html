                        <P>AHHHH I love this game series so much it's so near and dear to my heart....Portal 1 was one of the first games I purchased and back then it was really revolutionary for me: the characters are all funny in a really witty way, the story is really engaging and the puzzle gameplay is really well put together and fun. Overall, a really really REALLY good pair of games that I would genuinely recommend. 10/10</P>

                        <p>I LOVE POK&Eacute;MONNNNN!!!!!! It's a really fun RPG series that has a lot of cute and awesome creatures that you need to collect and battle with! The battle mechanics may be a bit sluggish at first, but you'll get used to it pretty quickly. ALSO, BW ARE GOOD GAMES NO MATTER WHAT THE HATERS SAY.</p>
                        <p>The anime is really cute as well, I love how wacky and silly it can be sometimes, but it also gets kinda serious when it needs to. Also, the animation is REALLY good, especially in the latest shows.</p>

                        <p>I love this game so much!!! Getting together with my group of irl friends and starting a campaign that usually lasts for a month or so is super awesome and exciting every time!! I love making new characters and seeing them grow together with our party...</p>
                        <p>Even though this version of DnD might have its flaws, it was the first version I started playing (ever) so it carries some nostalgic value to it :></p>
