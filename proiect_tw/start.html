        <p>
            This is PJ-D, a little web game I have designed to test my HTML skills and knowledge! Your job is to navigate the following pages and find the secret page at the end after figuring out all of the puzzles!
        </p>


        <div class="accordion">
            <div class="tab">
                <input type="checkbox" name="accordion-1" id="cb1">
                <label for="cb1" class="tab_label">The background story of PJ:D</label>
                <div class="tab_content">
                    <p>You are a top-level detective from the FBI that has been tracking down Elijah Natas, a billionaire that hasn't been seen or heard from for the last 10 years. You are tasked with uncovering the secrets of his company, HarbING Inc., through some old files left behind on his old laptop. You find one of his old webpages that he designed when he was a teenager, and you notice that one of them might have some valuable information for your investigation, so you decide to dig deeper. This will require you to solve a few puzzles left behind by Elijah Natas in order to access his deepest secrets from his early years. Good thing you have full control of the files on his machine!</p>

            <div class="tab">
                <input type="checkbox" name="accordion-1" id="cb2">
                <label for="cb2" class="tab_label">Important information</label>
                <div class="tab_content">
                    <p>Search every page top and down for clues, as some clues might require the use of other clues / elements in these pages.</p>
                    <p>Be on the lookout for any element or text that might look out of place / unfitting with the content around it! For example, links can and will be hidden in the page, even in some places where you least expect it!</p>
                    <p>Once you fully navigate a page and solve its puzzles for the first time, DO NOT forget that some pages (login pages etc.) might be used for more than one puzzle and might require you to come back and introduce new information to access new puzzles!</p>
                    <p>Adding onto the last tip, if you ever feel stuck, try to use whatever clue you have onto other pages that might've been "completed" before.</p>
